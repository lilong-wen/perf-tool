# perf-tool
perf modification, more user-friendly, based on linux perf tool

- TODO: Add more Python bindings to facilitate usage and visualization in Python.


## TODO
In the past few days, I have tried many ways to avoid making users to compile the perf tool themselves to get the python bindings of perf, but without success. I am currently trying another way to call the bash script through python, perhaps this could be a more convenient way for users.
